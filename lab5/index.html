		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab is to show the basic data types that can
			be used in Javascript and have them referenced in an HTML file.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>One major problem that I encountered was linking the js file to the
			html file. I had the syntax for linking the two files written correctly
			in the html file, and I believed that my code in the js file were all
			correct.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>After resolving all the issues I encountered, I was able to have the
			browser display what I wanted.</p>
