	<h1>Lab 3 - File Sturctures and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The main goal of this lab is for students like us to create and
		easily locate the file structure on their computers and have HTML
		file.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was difficult for someone as smooth-brained as me to get my
		self-image to pop up in my brower.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>After staring at my screen for 2 minutes, I edited my image link
		by copying-and-pasting the image pathway.</P>
