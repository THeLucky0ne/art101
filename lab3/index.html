	<h1>Lab 3 - File Sturctures and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The main goal of this lab is for students to be able to create
		a local file structure and be able to navigate inside it. Students
		are also expected to be able to add index.html files and upload files
		to a server.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I found myself having some issues with linking the image of
		myself to my browser.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>With the help of my partner, I was able to find out how to
		easily create the link to my image on Atom. She told me that
	  I could copy and paste the image pathway to my code. After
	  doing so, the image popped up in my browser.</P>

	<p>This image shows the pathway of my art101 folder and the
		layout of each child folder within.</p>

	<p>This image shows the coding for my browser in Atom. I added
		an arbitrary heading, a paragraph about myself, and an image
		of myself. The bulleted list of all the other labs have been
		linked below my image.</p>

		I have done in my code on Atom.</p>

	<p>This image shows my coding in Atom for the index.html file
		in the lab3 folder. The title of the lab is added at the top
		and in the heading. The goal of the lab is stated underneath,
	  with the challenges that I faced and the results of my work below.</p>
