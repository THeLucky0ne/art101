    <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate the use of
    loops in Javascript.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>One major issue I faced in this lab was figuring out
    how to display my code into my html browser. It took many
    attempts, but my partner and I were able to find the
    solution.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Below is a long list of numbers reaching 200, displaying
    strings next to some numbers. If a number was divisible by
    3, 5, 7, or a combination of them, the string respective to
    those numbers would show up.</p>
