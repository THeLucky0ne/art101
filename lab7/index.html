    <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how functions
    can be developed in Javascript. In this lab, a function that
    takes input from the user and mixes around that input's
    characters must be developed properly on Javascript.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>One minor issue that I can address was deciding whether to use
    the code provided by Wes or come up with my own way.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>Below the page is the output of my funciton fixUserName(),
    where the function takes the user's name as an input and
    mixes the letters around and returns a "better name".</p>
