    <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate what anon functions
    were and how to write them in Javascript. Then, time intervals
    had to be set up so that each funciton can be called back at
    certain times.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>One minor issue that I have experienced while doing the lab
    was the syntax for calling back the functions in my code. I was
    confused on how I should set up the console.log for each function
    so that they work properly in the console.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As a result of my efforts, I was able to call each function at
    certain time intervals, such as at the same time or one at a time.</p>
