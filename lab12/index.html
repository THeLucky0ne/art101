    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the use
    of if-else statements, or conditionals, within Javascript.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>One major issue that I had in Javascript was trying to
    figure out why clicking my button would not return the
    text. It took some time to figure out, but eventually the
    solution presented itself.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Below the page, there should be a window asking for the
    user's name with a button next to it. When the user enters
    his or her name, they will be assigned to a specific house,
    depending on the length of their name.</p>
