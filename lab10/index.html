    <h1>Lab 10: Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to experiment with events in
    Javascript by taking a name as input and scrambling it around
    within the HTML.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>The major issues that I encountered all relate to getting
    my Javascript code to develop for this lab. It was hard to
    understand what to do at first and how to start the code.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The output of my code should be displayed below, asking for
    the user's name. There is a button that the user can click to
    allow the code to scramble and return a new name.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="output">
    <span id="output">
    <label for "user-name">Please enter your name: </label>
    <input type= "text" name= "user-name" id= "user-name"><br/>
    <button id="my-button">Click to submit </button>
