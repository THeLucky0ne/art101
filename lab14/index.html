    <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab was to attempt to debug any of the
    previously-done labs.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>One major problem I had was trying to help someone on Stack
    Overflow with their issues. Though I had no lab that required
    some debugging, I still do not have a lot of experience in
    Javascript. Therefore, it was hard finding someone who was having
    problems with their code that I had a solution to.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I was able to help someone on Stack Overflow with their issue.</p>
