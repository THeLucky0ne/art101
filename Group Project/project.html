  <h1> Air Pollution </h1>
  <img src="">
  <p> Air pollution is the result of the release of contaminants into the air
    through many forms of emissions. These contaminants can prove harmful to
    the health of both human and animal life because they linger in the air
    that all living things must breathe in order to survive. The most common
    source of emitting such pollutants is from the burning of fossil fuels,
    which we depend on for generating energy. Fossil fuels release harmful
    chemicals into the atmosphere, which can affect the health of many.
    Another form of contaminant can be carbon dioxide, which is the main
    contributor to climate change since it raises the Earthâ€™s temperature.
    Smog is also formed when these contaminants are mixed with sunlight.
    Factories and industries would also release harmful chemicals into the
    atmosphere, such as carbon monoxide. In farms, pesticides and insecticides
    are used to keep crops safe from pests, which in turn pollute the air with
    the chemicals used in them. Air contaminants can also come naturally. For
    example, smoke is also emitted from volcanic eruptions and natural forest
    fires. Aside from the health issues, air pollution contributes to global
    warming and the destruction of the planet's ozone layer, which helps keep
    life safe from the Sun's dangerous rays.
