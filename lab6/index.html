		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this lab is to show how to write arrays and
			objects in Javascript and have them referenced in an html file.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>One issue I had personally was again linking the js file to
			the html file. I was sure that I had gottent the syntax for my
			code in Javascript correct, however my partner was able to point
			out specific mistakes that I had made. In the end, I was able to
			resolve the issue</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Shown below is the output of my Javascript code from the console
			browser.</p>
